      <description>Iâ€™m dual French-German Pharm.D./Ph.D. with years of research experience in immuno-oncology. Besides, being of an inquisitive nature, I usually get interested in miscellaneous subjects. I cultivate coding skills as well as a marked preference for Unix and R.
During my Ph.D. I rapidly got submerged in data, so that I eventually had to code on a daily basis. Looking back, this turned out to be the most successful and enjoyable part of my work.</description>
