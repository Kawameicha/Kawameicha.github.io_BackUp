      <description>In Germany we organize an election to decide who is allowed to form a government with Angela Merkel every fourth year. It’s truly boring and generally without any surprises. At the end, she gets elected whatever happens. In fact, among the youngest Germans, most aren’t really sure whether a man can be chancellor or not.
But this year was different. We had Martin Schulz, a man truly convinced he could take the leading role away from Angela Merkel and also the big comeback of Nazis.</description>
