      <description>In Germany we organize an election to decide who is allowed to form a government with Angela Merkel every fourth year. It’s truly boring and generally without any surprises. At the end, she gets elected whatever happens. In fact, among the youngest Germans, most aren’t really sure whether a man can be chancellor or not.
But this year was different. We had Martin Schulz, a man truly convinced he could take the leading role away from Angela Merkel and also the big comeback of Nazis.</description>

      <description>Lately I’ve discovered sentiment analysis that combines natural language processing with text analysis to basically identify (and quantify!) feelings created by words. Some R packages like the syuzhet package are now available from the CRAN and doing your very own natural language analysis has never been so easy.
Besides R packages, you will most certainly need some texts to analyze. For those of you who never heard about it, I would highly suggest having a look at the Project Gutenberg.</description>
