      <description>Many thousands of datasets are being published and regularly updated by government departments and agencies, public bodies or local authorities. Anybody can use this data to learn more about how government works, carry out research or build applications and services. All the data is made available through different datahubs and centralized in Europe via open data Europa.
On data.gov.uk I’ve found files providing detailed road safety data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents in Great Britain and the consequential casualties.</description>

      <description>Okay, my last post wasn’t really rocket science but did you ever heard about the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies North Korea Missile Test Database? This is the “first database to record flight tests of all missiles launched by North Korea capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilograms (1102.31 pounds) a distance of at least 300 kilometers (186.4 miles).”
Unfortunately, it has become quite clear that the North Korea’s missile program has accelerated and made substantial progress over the past couple of years.</description>

      <description>I’ve been doing basic accounting for a while now and last year I discovered the simple, yet powerful application Debit &amp;amp; Credit. I always thought it was a bit of a hassle, but ever since I’ve started to use it, I’ve been keeping track of every single expense. It does exactly what it tells: keeping financial records and never accessing my data. Of course this isn’t rocket science but it’s useful.</description>

      <description>I found this dataset at Harvard Dataverse - a collaboration with Harvard Library, Harvard University IT, and IQSS - about the most famous biographies present on Wikipedia. The Pantheon dataset is “a dataset of individuals that have transcended linguistic, temporal, and geographic boundaries.”
It includes 11,341 biographies present in more than 25 languages on Wikipedia and is “enriched with: (i) manually verified demographic information (place and date of birth, gender); (ii) a taxonomy of occupations classifying each biography at three levels of aggregation; and (iii) two measures of global popularity including the number of languages in which a biography is present in Wikipedia (L), and the Historical Popularity Index (HPI) a metric that combines information on L, time since birth, and page-views (2008-2013).</description>

      <title>Public Health Data from the WHO</title>

      <description>I’ve been looking for a simple and reliable access to public health data for a while now. Eventually, I bumped into the WHO package, which allows downloading directly from the World Health Organization’s Global Health Observatory in a dynamic and reproducible way. The data is accessible after you installed the package either from the CRAN or GitHub.
# From CRAN install.packages(&amp;quot;WHO&amp;quot;) # From Github library(devtools) install_github(&amp;quot;expersso/WHO&amp;quot;) Nothing fancy and the rest is pretty straightforward too: only two functions necessary.</description>
