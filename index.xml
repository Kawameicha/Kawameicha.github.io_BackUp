      <description>I’m dual French-German Pharm.D./Ph.D. with years of research experience in immuno-oncology. Besides, being of an inquisitive nature, I usually get interested in miscellaneous subjects. I cultivate coding skills as well as a marked preference for Unix and R.
During my Ph.D. I rapidly got submerged in data, so that I eventually had to code on a daily basis. Looking back, this turned out to be the most successful and enjoyable part of my work.</description>

      <title>To Eat, or not to Eat, that is the Question</title>

      <description>Mycology is the branch of biology concerned with the study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy and their use to humans as a source for tinder, medicine, food, and entheogens, as well as their dangers, such as toxicity or infection. It’s complicated and fascinating at the same time.
I wasn’t particularly fond of it at the university.
On the other hand I really enjoy eating mushroom. I normally buy them at the local market, so safety is no real concern of mine.</description>

      <description>Many thousands of datasets are being published and regularly updated by government departments and agencies, public bodies or local authorities. Anybody can use this data to learn more about how government works, carry out research or build applications and services. All the data is made available through different datahubs and centralized in Europe via open data Europa.
On data.gov.uk I’ve found files providing detailed road safety data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents in Great Britain and the consequential casualties.</description>

      <title>German Federal Election&#39;s Regional Differences</title>

      <description>In Germany we organize an election to decide who is allowed to form a government with Angela Merkel every fourth year. It’s truly boring and generally without any surprises. At the end, she gets elected whatever happens. In fact, among the youngest Germans, most aren’t really sure whether a man can be chancellor or not.
But this year was different. We had Martin Schulz, a man truly convinced he could take the leading role away from Angela Merkel and also the big comeback of Nazis.</description>

      <description>Okay, my last post wasn’t really rocket science but did you ever heard about the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies North Korea Missile Test Database? This is the “first database to record flight tests of all missiles launched by North Korea capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilograms (1102.31 pounds) a distance of at least 300 kilometers (186.4 miles).”
Unfortunately, it has become quite clear that the North Korea’s missile program has accelerated and made substantial progress over the past couple of years.</description>

      <title>Beginners&#39; Guide to Financial Report with R</title>

      <description>I’ve been doing basic accounting for a while now and last year I discovered the simple, yet powerful application Debit &amp;amp; Credit. I always thought it was a bit of a hassle, but ever since I’ve started to use it, I’ve been keeping track of every single expense. It does exactly what it tells: keeping financial records and never accessing my data. Of course this isn’t rocket science but it’s useful.</description>

      <description>I found this dataset at Harvard Dataverse - a collaboration with Harvard Library, Harvard University IT, and IQSS - about the most famous biographies present on Wikipedia. The Pantheon dataset is “a dataset of individuals that have transcended linguistic, temporal, and geographic boundaries.”
It includes 11,341 biographies present in more than 25 languages on Wikipedia and is “enriched with: (i) manually verified demographic information (place and date of birth, gender); (ii) a taxonomy of occupations classifying each biography at three levels of aggregation; and (iii) two measures of global popularity including the number of languages in which a biography is present in Wikipedia (L), and the Historical Popularity Index (HPI) a metric that combines information on L, time since birth, and page-views (2008-2013).</description>

      <title>How to Select a Reading Depending on your State of Mind</title>

      <description>Lately I’ve discovered sentiment analysis that combines natural language processing with text analysis to basically identify (and quantify!) feelings created by words. Some R packages like the syuzhet package are now available from the CRAN and doing your very own natural language analysis has never been so easy.
Besides R packages, you will most certainly need some texts to analyze. For those of you who never heard about it, I would highly suggest having a look at the Project Gutenberg.</description>

      <title>Public Health Data from the WHO</title>
      <link>/2016/04/public-health-data-from-the-who/</link>

      <guid>/2016/04/public-health-data-from-the-who/</guid>
      <description>I’ve been looking for a simple and reliable access to public health data for a while now. Eventually, I bumped into the WHO package, which allows downloading directly from the World Health Organization’s Global Health Observatory in a dynamic and reproducible way. The data is accessible after you installed the package either from the CRAN or GitHub.
# From CRAN install.packages(&amp;quot;WHO&amp;quot;) # From Github library(devtools) install_github(&amp;quot;expersso/WHO&amp;quot;) Nothing fancy and the rest is pretty straightforward too: only two functions necessary.</description>
