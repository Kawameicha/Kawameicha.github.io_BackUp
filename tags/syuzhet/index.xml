      <description>Lately Iâ€™ve discovered sentiment analysis that combines natural language processing with text analysis to basically identify (and quantify!) feelings created by words. Some R packages like the syuzhet package are now available from the CRAN and doing your very own natural language analysis has never been so easy.
Besides R packages, you will most certainly need some texts to analyze. For those of you who never heard about it, I would highly suggest having a look at the Project Gutenberg.</description>
