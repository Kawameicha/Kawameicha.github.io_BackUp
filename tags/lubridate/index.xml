      <description>Many thousands of datasets are being published and regularly updated by government departments and agencies, public bodies or local authorities. Anybody can use this data to learn more about how government works, carry out research or build applications and services. All the data is made available through different datahubs and centralized in Europe via open data Europa.
On data.gov.uk I’ve found files providing detailed road safety data about the circumstances of personal injury road accidents in Great Britain and the consequential casualties.</description>

      <description>Okay, my last post wasn’t really rocket science but did you ever heard about the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies North Korea Missile Test Database? This is the “first database to record flight tests of all missiles launched by North Korea capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilograms (1102.31 pounds) a distance of at least 300 kilometers (186.4 miles).”
Unfortunately, it has become quite clear that the North Korea’s missile program has accelerated and made substantial progress over the past couple of years.</description>

      <description>I’ve been doing basic accounting for a while now and last year I discovered the simple, yet powerful application Debit &amp;amp; Credit. I always thought it was a bit of a hassle, but ever since I’ve started to use it, I’ve been keeping track of every single expense. It does exactly what it tells: keeping financial records and never accessing my data. Of course this isn’t rocket science but it’s useful.</description>
