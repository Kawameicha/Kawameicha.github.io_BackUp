      <description>I found this dataset at Harvard Dataverse - a collaboration with Harvard Library, Harvard University IT, and IQSS - about the most famous biographies present on Wikipedia. The Pantheon dataset is “a dataset of individuals that have transcended linguistic, temporal, and geographic boundaries.”
It includes 11,341 biographies present in more than 25 languages on Wikipedia and is “enriched with: (i) manually verified demographic information (place and date of birth, gender); (ii) a taxonomy of occupations classifying each biography at three levels of aggregation; and (iii) two measures of global popularity including the number of languages in which a biography is present in Wikipedia (L), and the Historical Popularity Index (HPI) a metric that combines information on L, time since birth, and page-views (2008-2013).</description>
